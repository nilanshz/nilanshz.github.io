<h3>SABERPUNGLI WEB APP</h3>

<p>Saberpungli is a project from <em>Menkopolhukam</em> to fight against <em>pungli</em> in Indonesia. We made the web app for administration. People can also submit their complaint about&nbsp;<em>pungli</em> through the web app and hybrid mobile app (built with IONIC).<br>
  
<p>I made several modules for the web app (admin dashboard page and some administration modules)</p>
<p>I also made the RESTful API (in separated app) with Laravel using JWT as API Keys. This is my first time build an API with keys.</p>

<p><br /> Tech Stack :</p>
<ul>
    <li>Laravel 4.2 (web app)</li>
    <li>Laravel 5.2 (API Gateway) with JWT as API Keys</li>
    <li>MySQL</li>
    <li>Bootstrap</li>
    <li>jQuery</li>
</ul>

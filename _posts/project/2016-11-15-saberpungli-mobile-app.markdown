<h3>SABERPUNGLI MOBILE APP</h3>

<p>Saberpungli is a project from <em>Menkopolhukam</em> to fight against <em>pungli</em> in Indonesia. We made the web app for administration. People can also submit their complaint about&nbsp;<em>pungli</em> through the web app and hybrid mobile app (built with IONIC).<br>
  
<p>We are <em>forced</em> to build the mobile app with IONIC (hybrid app, bad on performance) because we have to deliver the app as quick as possibble. IONIC 1 is based on Angular 1 and since it's basically a web app wrapped like mobile app, we can produce the app for Android and IOS at the same time.</p>

<p><br /> Tech Stack :</p>
<ul>
    <li>Laravel 5.2 (API Gateway) with JWT as API Keys</li>
    <li>IONIC 1 (based on Angular 1)</li>
</ul>

Considering the site has been up for a few weeks, I am honestly surprised that I haven't noticed that I didn't even have a [Favicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) yet. It's such a simple thing to deploy, but I suppose I never had the motivation to make one.  

Honestly I may have done the worlds laziest favicon. I literally just took a letter, made it red and added a [drop shadow](https://docs.gimp.org/en/script-fu-drop-shadow.html "Link for the Lazy") in GIMP. The hardest part was probably installing GIMP.

To deploy the Favicon, I encountered the Website [realfavicongenerator](http://realfavicongenerator.net/), which alters all the Favicons so that they work on all sorts of devices. Simple UI and all sorts of customization options, would definitely recommend.

For those interested, [here](http://realfavicongenerator.net/featured_favicons/p1bdcrdhkc1c5uk7f1l9v1vgt1qgv6) is how all the icons look on different devices.

In other news, I am trying out an [auto-tweeter](https://ifttt.com). Currently, the IFTTT script is hooked to the site's [RSS Feed](/feed.xml), meaning once a new post is posted, it shall soon after be posted on my Twitter Feed. Got to somehow keep up that social media presence I suppose...

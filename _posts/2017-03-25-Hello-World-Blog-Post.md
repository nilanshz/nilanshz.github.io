This blog is going to be focused on an introduction into Web Development with Jekyll. I am going to delve into my experiences with Jekyll, GitHub Sites, Ruby, Markdown, HTML, CSS and perhaps even a bit of Javascript from the perspective from someone with absolutely no web development history. Lots of trial and error occurred while trying to get to this point, so I might as well post some experiences, that can help someone else trying to learn how to do this.

This is my first post under the category blog to test the new features in the `posts.html` page. Reason being that I need an actual post in a different category, so yeah.
